Honestly, this is for my own sanity, AI, Google and YouTube with such generous contributors have without doubt made me a better thinker, developer and communicator. 

This digital garden helps me keep track of what I have used and benefitted from. If it helps you in any way I am honoured.

**First... What's a Digital Garden?**

'A digital garden is a kind of digital refuge, a retreat to get in touch with your own ideas. Basically, it is usually a website, a kind of chaotic blog made up of unfinished text fragments, notes and ideas. These ideas undergo constant development by the author, sometimes merging and refining them.' 

'With blogging, you’re talking to a large audience. With digital gardening, you’re talking to yourself. You focus on what you want to cultivate over time.'
