## What is it?

BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) is a structured methodology for building software using AI agents as collaborative team members. It organizes development into personas (PM, Architect, Developer, etc.) with defined workflows, enabling systematic progression from ideation through to production-ready code while maintaining quality and consistency.
